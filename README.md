# My Personal Blog
- A blog is a discussion or informational website published consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries. Posts are         typically displayed in reverse order, so that the most recent post appears first. My blog consists of soccer articles and in order for it    to fully function there has to be a homepage which will display an overview of what the blog is about, as well as showcasing the top 3       blog posts.

- With my Blog I will be using the CRUD application alongside json servers. CRUD is also a term frequently used in the design of UI (user      interface) and UX (user experience), as many web applications' main functionality involves these four basic functions. JSON is a data        format that consists of key-value pairs in the form of strings. The name/value pairs are separated by a colon and each pair is separated     by a comma.
