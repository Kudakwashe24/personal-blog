# My Personal Blog
- A blog is a discussion or informational website published consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries. Posts are         typically displayed in reverse order, so that the most recent post appears first. My blog consists of soccer articles and in order for it    to fully function there has to be a homepage which will display an overview of what the blog is about, as well as showcasing the top 3       blog posts.
